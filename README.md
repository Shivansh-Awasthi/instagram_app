# instagram_app
 This is a basic Node.js and Express application that simulates a simple Instagram-like platform. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:  Setting Up Express:  Requires the express, path, and uuid modules. Initializes an Express application and sets the view engine to EJS. Specifies the directory where the views (EJS templates) are located. Configures static file serving using express.static() to serve CSS and client-side JavaScript files. Parses incoming request bodies using express.json() and express.urlencoded() middleware. Implements method overriding using method-override middleware. Data:  Initializes an array named posts to store post objects. Each post object has an id, username, img (image URL), and caption. Routing:  Defines routes for different operations: GET /insta: Renders the homepage (index.ejs) with all posts. GET /insta/new: Renders the form (new.ejs) to create a new post. POST /insta: Creates a new post and redirects to the homepage. GET /insta/:id: Renders the details of a specific post (show.ejs) based on its ID. PATCH /insta/:id: Updates the caption and image of a specific post and redirects to the homepage. GET /insta/:id/edit: Renders the form (edit.ejs) to edit a specific post. DELETE /insta/:id: Deletes a specific post and redirects to the homepage. Listening for Requests:  Starts the server and listens on port 3000. Outputs a message to the console indicating that the server is running. Overall, this application allows users to view existing posts, create new posts, edit existing posts, and delete posts, providing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality similar to Instagram.
